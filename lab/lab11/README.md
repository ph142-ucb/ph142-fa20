README Lab 11 (fall)

This lab is all about linear regression on the Boston housing dataset. It looks at the relationship between home value and nitrous oxide concentration, then home value and distance to employment centers.



We've come a long way... this is the last official lab you'll be doing on RStudios.

We hope you've learned a lot about statistics and its application to biostatistics :))

As always, feel free to reach out to any of us if you have any questions and such.

So sad to see the semester almost done... *sob*
