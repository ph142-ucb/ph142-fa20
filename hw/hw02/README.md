To Do:

1. Replace due date with the date the solutions will be released.

3. Comment out the line in the setup code chunk that states `source("setup/hw02.RAGS.R")` and add a line that states `source("hw02.RAGS-hidden.R")`
4. Open hw02.RAGS-hidden.R and replace the line that states `source("setup/autograder_setup.R")` with `source(../common/setup/autograder_setup.R")`
5. Go through and check the autograder. Replace error messages with more informative messages if necessary.
6. Return to hw02-sol.Rmd and read through for spelling, grammar, and clarity. If you have a question, please ask!
7. Run the `total_score()` code at the bottom and be sure you pass all checkpoints.
