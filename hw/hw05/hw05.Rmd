* Homework 5 Solutions will be released Tuesday, October 6th.

* Remember: autograder is meant as sanity check ONLY. It will not tell you if you have the correct answer. It will tell you if you are in the ball park of the answer so *CHECK YOUR WORK*.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
# Don't change these lines, just run them!

```

Helpful hints:

- Every function you need to use was taught during lecture! So you may need to 
revisit the lecture code to help you along by opening the relevant files on Datahub. 
Alternatively, you may wish to view the code in the condensed PDFs posted 
on the course website. Good luck!

- Knit your file early and often to minimize knitting errors! If you copy and 
paste code for the slides, you are bound to get an error that is hard to 
diagnose. Typing out the code is the way to smooth knitting! We recommend 
knitting your file each time after you write a few sentences/add a new code 
chunk, so you can detect the source of knitting errors more easily. This will 
save you and the GSIs from frustration! **You must knit correctly before submitting.**

- To avoid code running off the page, have a look at your knitted PDF and ensure all the code fits in the file. If it doesn't look right, go back to your .Rmd file and add spaces (new lines) using the return or enter key so that the code runs onto the next line.

**[7 points] Part 1: Pregnancy Length Probabilities** 

An average pregnancy for humans lasts 266 days, with a standard deviation of 
16 days. Assume that human pregnancies are Normally distributed. 

1. [3 marks] Approximately what proportion of births are expected to occur on or before 
298 days? To aid your answer, hand-draw (or use any software) to sketch a Normal
curve, and shade in the area under the Normal density curve the question 
represents. Add dashed lines at the mean +/- 1SD, 2SD and 3SD. Then calculate 
the proportion asked about in the first sentence. You shouldn't need to use R
to perform any calculations for this question. Report the proportion to one decimal place.

(Use the code chunk below to include an image file of your drawing. To do so you 
need to delete the hashtag, upload the image to Datahub into the `src` directory and replace the file name with your file name. JPG or PNG will both work.)

```{r, out.width="50%"}
#knitr::include_graphics("src/Your-file-name.JPG")
```


\newpage


2. [1 mark] Check your answer from part a) using R code. Create a vector called `p2` that stores 2 values: your answer from part a and the absolute difference between your answer from a and the exact probability that you calcuated with code.

```{r}
p2 <- "Your answer here"

p2
check_problem2()
```


\newpage


3. [3 marks] What is the range, in days, that the middle 50% of pregnancies last? To aid 
your answer, hand-draw (or use any software) to sketch a Normal curve, and
shade in the area that the middle represents. 
Then, use R to calculate the requested range. Round the lower and upper bound of
the range each to two decimal places.

(Use the code chunk below to include an image file of your drawing. To do so you 
need to delete the hashtag, upload the image to Datahub into the `src` directory and replace the file name with your file name. JPG or PNG will both work.)

```{r}
#knitr::include_graphics("src/Your-file-name.JPG")
```


```{r}
#Your code here

**[7 points] Part 2: Assessing Normality and Interpreting QQ Plots** 

The number of trees for nine plots of land, each of 0.1 hectare, have been 
recorded. They are: 18, 4, 22, 15, 18, 19, 22, 12, 12. Are these data Normally 
distributed?


\newpage


4. [3 marks] Make a Normal quantile plot for these data using R. Remember, to make a ggplot
of these data, you need to first input the data as a vector and then convert that
vector to a data frame. Example code has been provided to you to get you started.
After making the plot, assess whether the data appear to approximately follow a 
Normal distribution.

```{r ggplot_qqplot,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
# example code
counts <- c(1, 2, 3)
tree_data <- data.frame(counts)

# your code for ggplot here 


```

5. [4 marks] Read [this blog post](http://seankross.com/2016/02/29/A-Q-Q-Plot-Dissection-Kit.html) 
by Sean Kross (up to and including the Takeaways). No need
to read the updates, or to understand the code Sean is using--it is different 
from the code we've been learning in class. Pay most attention to the 
presentation of the Quantile-Quantile plots for all the distributions he presents.
Important note: Sean is plotting "Q-Q" plots and we've been plotting Normal quantile
plots. Q-Q plots are a little different, but the same takeaways apply, meaning 
that if you understand how to interpret Q-Q plots, you can also apply those interpretations
to Normal quantile plots.

Look at the charts entitled "Skewed right" and "Skewed left" and the Quantile-Quantile plots
beside them. Why does the Quantile-Quantile plot for the skewed right plot curve upwards and to the right 
(i.e., above the line), while the Quantile-Quantile plot for the skewed left plot curve 
downwards and to the left?

**[15 points] Part 3: Conducting a general anxiety disorder study** 

Suppose that a new treatment for general anxiety disorder has undergone 
safety and efficacy trials and based on these data 30% of patients with 
general anxiety disorder are expected to benefit from the new treatment. You are
conducting a follow-up study and so far have enrolled 8 participants with 
general anxiety disorder into your study. These patients do not know each other
and represent individuals who responded to a call for study participants that 
they saw on a flyer on campus. 


\newpage


6. [2 marks] Let $X$ represent the number of patients that you have enrolled who benefit
from the treatment. Does $X$ meet the assumptions of a Binomial distribution? 
Thoroughly explain why or why not.

[TODO: YOUR ANSWER HERE]



\newpage


7. [1 mark] Use one of the distributions we learnt in class (where $X$ meets the assumptions) to calculate (by hand) the probability that exactly 5 participants will benefit.
Show your work.

8. [1 mark] Confirm your previous calculation using an R function and store your answer to p18.

```{r}
p8 <- "Your answer here"
p8

check_problem8()
```


\newpage


9. [2 marks] Calculate (by hand) the probability that 6 or more participants will benefit. 
Show your work.

10. [1 mark] Confirm your previous calculation using the function `pbinom()` and store your answer to p10.

```{r}
p10 <- "Your answer here"
p10


check_problem10()

```


\newpage


11. [1 mark] Re-confirm your previous calculation, this time using the function `dbinom()` and store your answer to p11.

```{r}
p11 <- "your answer here"
p11


check_problem11()

```


\newpage


12. [2 marks] Interpret the binomial coefficient, ${8 \choose 7}$, in the context of this 
study. Write out all the possible combinations to achieve ${8 \choose 7}$.

\newpage


13. [4 marks] Calculate the number of patients you would expect to benefit 
from the treatment. Then calculate the standard deviation of this estimate. 
Write a sentence to interpret the meaning of the mean. If the mean is not a whole number, what whole number is most probable?

[TODO: YOUR ANSWER HERE]



\newpage


14. [1 mark] Should you apply a Normal approximation to these data using the $\mu$ and $\sigma$
you calculated in the last question? Why or why not?
